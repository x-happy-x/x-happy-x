Hi, Iâ€™m Abdulla from Rostov-on-Don. Having tried many directions, I decided to settle on Java development. Iâ€™m interested in both backend development and mobile (for Android). Sometimes I write some scripts in Python.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m studying technologies that interest me: Camunda, Spring, Docker, and others.
  
- ðŸ˜„ I love to help people.
  
- âš¡ I automate everything that is possible and impossible (he-he).
  
- ðŸ¤” In search of work and trying to finish my studies.
